Udemy downloader
================

*Download Udemy course files for offline use*

This is just a toy project to learn something new about Haskell. Use some libraries that I have not used before. So far it has been a joyful ride! During the development of this project I learned a lot about these libraries:

* http-conduit
* html-conduit
* aeson

It was also my first time with heavy use of ByteStrings and Text. I was confused a bit in the beginning but in the end it feels quite natural to use all those different string representations. It is also worth mentioning about such library as parallel-io which made it possible to download stuff from Udemy concurrently in a matter of seconds (I think I edited just 2 lines to make it work).
